# Ant-Colony-Simulation
An imaginary simulation of a ant colony 
The program is developed on the principles of Object Orinented Programming 
  for instance: 
    - there is an ant super class
    - the ant class then branches off into many seperate types of ants that essentially have the same code (moving, eating algorithm)
